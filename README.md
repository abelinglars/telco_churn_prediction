## Abstract
Exploratory data analysis of telecommunication churn data, fitting a model to predict churn and productionising it with fastapi and docker.

## Intro
Retaining customers is a lot cheaper than acquiring new ones. Finding out, which factors lead to clients choosing another product not only gives insight into the market but also empowers companies to proactively engage in customer retention methods.

Churn prediction enables to target prevention strategies at high risk clients and potentially mitigate churn.

This repo explores telecommunications data in order to analyze demographic and operational variables and their influence on the customers proclivity to churn. After doing a exploratory analysis, a machine learning model will be fitted, packaged and deployed to make on demand inferences in a production setting using fastapi and docker.
